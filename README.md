## Status :: 
Rev1 has been ordered, picked the wrong LDOs, wired the circuit protection wrong (easily fixable with bodge wiring)
**Fixed** all issues of rev1 in current revision.

Case is mostly done, **rev 3** is recommended to be used, rev2 features spacing issues for 3d prints and thus should not be picked anymore.
 
VIAL firmware is ready and functioning as intended,
additional Led-Breakout hasnt been tested yet, **needs validation**
